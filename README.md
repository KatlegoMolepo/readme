# WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN LEARNING
Currently, i am enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand studying my dream _ASTRONOMY_.From the intro sentence you should already have an idea of what im interested in learning. Astronomy is the study of space and the objects located within space(celestrial objects),in short studying the universe as a whole.
# WHAT ARE MY FAVOURTE HOBBIES
*I love watching various types of series, ranging within anime to realism.
*I Love playing video games, especially with my cousin on the application called _ROBLOX_.
*I dont know if starring at beautiful scenery is a hobby but if it is, I love it!
*Weirdly, I love cleaning I find it therapeutic.
